# To Do Web App
we will learn how to build a Money Tracker WebApp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application will help you keep track of your expenses and gain better control over your spending.

We will start by creating the basic HTML file with a title, heading, form, and expense list container. Then, we will apply basic CSS styles for a visually appealing look. Next, we will capture form input, validate it, create an expense object, and store it in an array. We will then dynamically loop through the expense array and create HTML elements to display expenses. We will implement a delete functionality to remove expenses from the array and update the rendered list. Finally, youâ€™ll have a functional web application that allows you to add and remove expenses, helping you gain better control over your spending
